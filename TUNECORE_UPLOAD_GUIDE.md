Paste full lyrics:

I'm in love with the ocean
The beat and the motion
When I'm dancing for you

Golden sand beneath my feet
Cyprus sun and summer heat
Every move feels so true

Can you feel it in the air?
The rhythm everywhere
This moment we can share

Can you feel it too?
Can you feel it too?
Dancing under skies so blue
I'm in love with the ocean
When I'm dancing for you

Waves are crashing on the shore
This is what I'm living for
Summer days with you

Sunset paints the sky so bright
Dancing through the fading light
Making memories new

Can you feel it in the air?
The rhythm everywhere
This moment we can share

Can you feel it too?
Can you feel it too?
Dancing under skies so blue
I'm in love with the ocean
When I'm dancing for you

Let the waves wash over me
Feel the music, feel so free
Dancing by the Mediterranean Sea
This is where I want to be

Can you feel it too?
Can you feel it too?
Dancing under skies so blue
I'm in love with the ocean
When I'm dancing for you

Dancing for you
Dancing for you
