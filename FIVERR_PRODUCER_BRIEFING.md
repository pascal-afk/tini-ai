# Fiverr Producer Briefing - Cyprus Sun Final Master

**Project:** Transform Cyprus Sun from AI-demo to TuneCore-ready professional release  
**Genre:** Tropical House / Deep House Pop (Kygo/Sigala style)  
**Budget:** $150-250 USD  
**Timeline:** 7-10 days  
**Your Role:** Final vocal treatment, arrangement tweaks, professional mastering  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Transform an AI-generated demo (Google Flow vocals + AI-generated music) into a **release-ready Tropical House track** that passes DSP quality checks (TuneCore/Spotify/Apple Music) and avoids Content ID similarity flags.

---

## 📁 Files You'll Receive

### **Primary Files:**

1. **cyprus_sun_tunecore_master.wav** (19 MB)
   - Original TuneCore-mastered version (44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo)
   - Duration: 1:47 (107 seconds)
   - This is your starting point

2. **cyprus_sun_vocal_chop.wav** (19 MB)
   - **Pre-processed version** with:
     - ✅ Telephone EQ applied (400-4000Hz bandpass)
     - ✅ Moderate saturation (4dB drive)
     - ✅ Light reverb (room 0.4, wet 0.25)
     - ✅ Pitch shifted -1 semitone
   - **USE THIS as your main working file** - saves you time!

3. **CYPRUS_SUN_PROCESSING_REPORT.md**
   - Detailed technical analysis of what's already been done
   - Processing techniques applied
   - Recommendations for final touches

### **Optional Reference Files:**

- `cyprus_sun_lofi.wav` - Heavy lo-fi version (for style reference)
- `cyprus_sun_pitch_±Xst.wav` - Various pitch variations (if you need alternatives)

---

## ✅ What's Already Been Done

To save you time and effort, the following processing has **already been completed**:

### **Stage 1: Initial Processing (DONE)**
- ✅ **Telephone EQ:** Bandpass filter (400-4000Hz) removes AI artifacts
- ✅ **Saturation:** 4dB drive adds analog warmth
- ✅ **Reverb:** Light spatial processing (room 0.4, wet 0.25)
- ✅ **Pitch Shift:** -1 semitone for warmer vocal character
- ✅ **Peak Normalized:** Ready for further processing

**Result:** The harsh AI vocal sound is already masked. You're starting with a much cleaner base.

---

## 🎛️ Your Tasks (What Still Needs To Be Done)

### **Task 1: Formant Shifting** (CRITICAL)
**Why:** Changes the "throat size" of the AI vocal, making it unrecognizable as AI-generated

**Instructions:**
1. Load `cyprus_sun_vocal_chop.wav` into your DAW
2. Apply **Little AlterBoy** (Soundtoys) or **MAutoPitch** (Melda Production)
3. Settings:
   - **Formant Shift:** -2 to -3 semitones (experiment to find sweet spot)
   - **Pitch:** Keep at 0 (already shifted in pre-processing)
   - **Mix:** 100% wet
4. **Goal:** The vocal should sound like a different singer/character

**Why this wasn't done earlier:** Requires specialized DAW plugins not available in automated processing

---

### **Task 2: Vocal Chop Drop (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)**
**Why:** Transforms the vocal from "lead singer" to "sampled instrument" (safer for Content ID)

**Instructions:**
1. Identify the chorus phrase: **"So beautiful"** or similar
2. Slice into individual **vowel sounds only**: "Oh", "Euu", "Ah"
   - Discard consonants (that's where AI artifacts are most audible)
3. Create a new **rhythmic pattern** for the drop section
   - Example rhythm: "Oh - Oh - Euu - Ah - (Rest) - Ah - Euu - Oh"
   - Make it dance-y and syncopated (not just straight quarter notes)
4. Apply **heavy reverb** (room size 0.7, wet 0.4)
5. Apply **sidechain compression** triggered by kick drum
   - Threshold: -20dB, Ratio: 8:1, Attack: 1ms, Release: 150ms

**Style Reference:** Major Lazer, DJ Snake, Marshmello vocal chops

**If time is limited:** Skip this step and just do formant shifting (still effective)

---

### **Task 3: Instrumental Humanization** (OPTIONAL)
**Why:** AI-generated music is perfectly quantized (too robotic)

**Instructions:**
1. **Percussion layering:**
   - Layer **organic foley sounds** over existing snare/clap
   - Suggestions: wood blocks, real handclaps, shakers
   - Volume: 20-30% blend with existing drums
   
2. **Groove/Swing:**
   - Apply a slight **Swing template** (52-55%) to percussion and bass
   - Or manually shift MIDI/audio by 5-10ms on off-beats
   
3. **MIDI Humanization (if you have MIDI access):**
   - Randomize velocity: ±5-10%
   - Randomize timing: ±5-10ms

**If time is limited:** Skip this step - the vocal treatment is more critical

---

### **Task 4: Structure Enhancement** (OPTIONAL)
**Why:** AI songs often loop the same 4-bar pattern (boring)

**Instructions:**
1. Add a **Bridge section** before the final drop
   - Remove drums and bass
   - Keep only piano + vocal (or minimal elements)
   - Duration: 8 bars (15-20 seconds)
   - Purpose: Creates dynamic contrast and "compositional intent"

**If time is limited:** Skip this step

---

### **Task 5: Final Mastering** (REQUIRED)
**Why:** Ensures broadcast-ready quality for streaming platforms

**Instructions:**
1. **Target Loudness:** -14 LUFS (Spotify/Apple Music standard)
2. **True Peak:** -1.0 dB maximum (avoid clipping)
3. **Stereo Width:** Slight stereo widening on vocals (not too much)
4. **Reference Tracks:** 
   - Kygo - "Firestone"
   - Sigala - "Easy Love"
   - Match the tonal balance and energy

**Export Settings:**
- Format: WAV 44.1kHz / 16-bit
- Dithering: Triangular (if downsampling from 24-bit)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to separate vocals from instrumental?**  
A: No! The pre-processed file (`cyprus_sun_vocal_chop.wav`) is already ready to work with. You can apply formant shifting to the entire mix (it will primarily affect vocals).

**Q: What if I don't have Little AlterBoy?**  
A: Any formant shifter works:
- MAutoPitch (Melda Production - FREE)
- Pitch Monster (Devious Machines)
- GSnap (GVST - FREE)
- Built-in formant tools in Logic Pro X or FL Studio

**Q: Can I use my own creative ideas?**  
A: Yes! As long as the final master:
1. Passes TuneCore quality check
2. Sounds professional
3. Has formant-shifted vocals

**Q: What if TuneCore still rejects it?**  
A: Very unlikely after formant shifting + mastering. But if it happens, I'll request 1 revision to adjust. This is covered in the price.
