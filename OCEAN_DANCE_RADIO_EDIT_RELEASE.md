## 📝 SONG STRUCTURE

### Full Radio Edit Structure (2:53)

```
[0:00-0:08] Intro - Instrumental
            Ocean waves, tropical percussion builds

[0:08-0:28] Verse 1
            I'm in love with the ocean
            The beat and the motion
            When I'm dancing for you
            
            Golden sand beneath my feet
            Cyprus sun and summer heat
            Every move feels so true

[0:28-0:38] Pre-Chorus
            Can you feel it in the air?
            The rhythm everywhere
            This moment we can share

[0:38-0:58] Chorus
            Can you feel it too?
            Can you feel it too?
            Dancing under skies so blue
            I'm in love with the ocean
            When I'm dancing for you

[0:58-1:18] Verse 2
            Waves are crashing on the shore
            This is what I'm living for
            Summer days with you
            
            Sunset paints the sky so bright
            Dancing through the fading light
            Making memories new

[1:18-1:28] Pre-Chorus (Repeat)
            Can you feel it in the air?
            The rhythm everywhere
            This moment we can share

[1:28-1:48] Chorus (Repeat)
            Can you feel it too?
            Can you feel it too?
            Dancing under skies so blue
            I'm in love with the ocean
            When I'm dancing for you

[1:48-2:08] Bridge - Instrumental Break
            Tropical dance section

[2:08-2:28] Bridge - Vocals
            Let the waves wash over me
            Feel the music, feel so free
            Dancing by the Mediterranean Sea
            This is where I want to be

[2:28-2:53] Final Chorus + Outro
            Can you feel it too?
            Can you feel it too?
            Dancing under skies so blue
            I'm in love with the ocean
            When I'm dancing for you
            
            Dancing for you
            Dancing for you
            
            (Fade out with ocean waves)
