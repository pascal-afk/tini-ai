---

## 🔬 What Makes Move Lyrics Patentable?

### ✅ STRONGLY PATENTABLE Components

#### 1. **Guitar Hero Scrolling for Dance Instructions**
**Novelty:** First application of Guitar Hero-style scrolling UI to dance choreography education.

**Technical Innovation:**
- Beat-synchronized text elements scroll vertically from bottom to top
- Current beat highlights in center viewport while future beats preview above
- Past beats fade and scroll away below
- Timing synchronized to BPM and 8-count structure

**Prior Art Search Results:** 
- ❌ No existing patents for Guitar Hero-style dance instruction
- ❌ No dance apps use scrolling beat-synchronized text
- ✅ Guitar Hero scrolling exists for music games, but NOT for dance education

**Patent Claim Focus:**
> "A method and system for displaying dance instructions wherein textual instructions are presented in a vertically scrolling format synchronized to musical beats, with current instructions highlighted in a center viewport and future instructions previewed above, creating a continuous flow of beat-by-beat choreographic guidance."

---

#### 2. **Beat-Synchronized Body Part Breakdown Overlay**
**Novelty:** Real-time display of simultaneous body part actions synchronized to musical beats.

**Technical Innovation:**
```
Beat 3 Display:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Torso: Lean forward 45°     │
│ Right Arm: Extend horizontal │
│ Left Arm: Pull to chest     │
│ Legs: Right foot diagonal   │
│ Head: Look right            │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Prior Art Search Results:**
- ❌ No existing dance apps show body part breakdown per beat
- ✅ Some fitness apps show static poses, but NOT synchronized to music beats
- ✅ Dance notation systems exist (Labanotation), but NOT as real-time scrolling overlay

**Patent Claim Focus:**
> "A system for displaying choreographic instructions comprising a synchronized overlay displaying simultaneous actions for multiple body parts (torso, arms, legs, head) timed to musical beats, wherein each beat triggers display of coordinated multi-limb instructions."

---

#### 3. **Three-Level Detail System with Automatic Beat Synchronization**
**Novelty:** Adaptive instruction complexity synchronized to same musical timeline.

**Technical Innovation:**
- **Simple Mode:** "Step right, arms up" (beginner-friendly)
- **Standard Mode:** "Right foot 45° diagonal, arms shoulder height" (intermediate)
- **Detailed Mode:** "Right foot 45° diagonal with 10° knee bend, arms parallel to floor with 15° elbow flex" (advanced)
- All three levels synchronized to identical musical beats and timestamps

**Prior Art Search Results:**
- ❌ No dance apps offer multiple detail levels synchronized to same music
- ✅ Educational apps show progressive difficulty, but NOT synchronized to beats

**Patent Claim Focus:**
> "A method for delivering choreographic instruction at multiple complexity levels wherein simple, standard, and detailed textual descriptions of identical movements are synchronized to the same musical beat timestamps, allowing users to toggle detail level while maintaining temporal synchronization."

---

#### 4. **Count-In Timer Preparation System**
**Novelty:** Automated countdown synchronized to musical phrase structure preparing learner for choreography start.

**Technical Innovation:**
- System detects choreography start time
- Calculates preceding bar timing based on BPM
- Displays count-in sequence: "5-6-7-8" or "5-6-7-8-GO!"
- Learner has exact time to get into starting position
- Synchronized to musical phrasing (typically 4 or 8 counts before start)

**Patent Claim Focus:**
> "An automated preparation system for choreographic instruction comprising a countdown display synchronized to musical phrase structure, providing preparatory count-in beats preceding choreography onset, timed to the musical tempo and phrase boundaries."

---

### ⚠️ MODERATELY PATENTABLE Components

#### 5. **Algorithmic Beat-to-Instruction Mapping**
**Technical Description:**
- BPM-based timestamp calculation: `timestamp_ms = (beat_number / BPM) * 60000`
- Automatic synchronization of text display to video playback
- Dynamic adjustment for tempo changes

**Patentability:** Moderate (algorithms are harder to patent, but specific implementation may qualify)

**Strategy:** Include as part of larger system patent, not standalone algorithm patent.

---

#### 6. **Three-Mode Display System**
**Three Visualization Modes:**
1. **Guitar Hero Mode:** Scrolling from bottom to top (default)
2. **Overlay Mode:** Text overlays video content
3. **Side-by-Side Mode:** Video and instructions displayed adjacently

**Patentability:** Moderate (UI layouts are harder to patent alone)

**Strategy:** Combine with scrolling mechanism and beat synchronization for stronger patent.

---

### ❌ WEAK PATENTABILITY (Not Core Focus)

#### 7. **Database Schema for Beat-by-Beat Instructions**
Pure data structure - not patentable alone.

**Reason:** Ideas and data organization alone cannot be patented; only novel technical implementations.

---

## 📋 Recommended Patent Strategy

### Phase 1: Provisional Patent Application (Immediate - Next 30 Days)

**Cost:** $100-200 (DIY) or $500-1,500 (with patent attorney)  
**Protection:** 12 months to file full patent

**What to File:**
- Detailed description of Guitar Hero scrolling for dance
- Body part breakdown synchronized display system
- Three-level detail system with beat synchronization
- Count-in timer mechanism

**DIY vs Attorney:**
- **DIY Provisional:** Use USPTO form, write detailed description yourself - $100-200
- **Attorney Provisional:** Professional drafting, stronger claims - $500-1,500

**Recommendation:** Start with DIY provisional to secure priority date NOW, then upgrade to attorney for full patent application.

---

### Phase 2: Full Utility Patent Application (Within 12 Months)

**Cost:** $5,000-15,000 (with attorney)  
**Timeline:** 2-4 years to approval  
**Protection:** 20 years from filing date

✅ File with USPTO and pursue international (PCT) if budget allows

---

### Phase 3: Design Patent (Optional - Year 2)

**Cost:** $1,500-3,000  
**Timeline:** 1-2 years to approval  
**Protection:** 15 years from grant date

**What to Patent:**
- Visual appearance of Guitar Hero scrolling interface
- Beat counter circular display design
- Move Lyrics overlay visual style

**Benefit:** Easier to enforce than utility patent, complements utility patent protection.
