## 🎯 Demo Video Konzept

### **"Show, Don't Tell" - Investor Pitch Video (20-25 seconds)**

```
Visual Narrative:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Scene 1 (5s): Virtual Studio + Nadja + Holo UI  │
│ Scene 2 (5s): Move Lyrics Guitar Hero Scrolling │
│ Scene 3 (8s): Dance Performance with Sync       │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach (2 Weeks) - Real Nadja + AI Compositing** 🎥 BEST BALANCE

**Method:** Record real Nadja dancing + AI-generated studio environment

**Tools:**

**Pros:**

**Workflow:**
```
Week 1:

- Design Move Lyrics UI (Figma mockups)

Week 2:
- Composite Nadja + virtual studio (green screen keying)
- Animate Move Lyrics scrolling (After Effects)
- Add voice counting + music sync
- Color grading + final polish
```

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Nadja video shoot: $0 (if she does it)

- ✅ **API available** (future product integration)

**Cons:**
- ⏰ 3-4 weeks timeline (avatar training + generation)
- 💰 Higher cost ($1,000-3,000 for custom avatar)
- 🎭 May lack "human touch" compared to real Nadja

**Workflow:**
```
Week 1: Record Nadja training footage (2-3 min video)
Week 2: HeyGen trains custom avatar
Week 3: Generate choreography videos with avatar
Week 4: Add Move Lyrics UI + polish
```

**Cost Breakdown:**
- HeyGen Pro subscription: $120/month (cancel after)
- Custom avatar training: $1,000-3,000 (one-time)

│  Lyrics A   │  Lyrics B   │
│  Visible    │  Hidden     │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
