## Questions for Higgsfield Team

### Technical Capabilities
1. **Avatar Customization:** Can you create a specific dancer avatar matching reference photos? (If yes, I can provide Nadja's photos)
2. **UI Overlay Rendering:** Can holographic UI elements be rendered as part of the 3D scene? Or should we add them in post-production?
3. **Motion Precision:** Can choreography be specified beat-by-beat? Or do you work with full video reference?
4. **Voice Integration:** Can you generate/integrate AI voice counting synchronized to beats?
5. **Multi-Dancer Scenes:** Can Scene 4 (two dancers side-by-side) be rendered? Or is it single-avatar only?

### Workflow & Timeline
6. **Input Format:** Do you need:
   - Written choreography descriptions (as above)?
   - Reference dance video (I can provide)?
   - Storyboard/animatic?
7. **Iteration Process:** How many revision rounds are included?
8. **Turnaround Time:** What's realistic timeline from brief to final video?
9. **Pricing:** What's the cost for:
   - 20-25 second cinematic video?
   - Additional 10s/15s edits?
   - Commercial usage rights?

### Export Options
10. **3D Assets:** Can you export the virtual studio environment as 3D model (GLB/FBX)?
11. **Avatar Export:** Can the dancer avatar be exported for use in other scenes?
12. **Green Screen:** Can you render dancer separately on green screen (for post-production flexibility)?

## Alternative Approach (If Full Service Too Expensive)

If full video production is beyond budget, we could work in phases:

**Phase 1: Studio Environment Only**
- Just render the futuristic glass studio (5s loop)
- We'll composite real dancer footage + UI elements

**Phase 2: Avatar + Basic Movement**
- Single avatar in studio, simple choreography (10s)
- We add Move Lyrics UI in post

**Phase 3: Full Production**
- Complete vision with all scenes (when budget allows)

## Additional Notes

### Business Context
This demo video is for **seed funding pitch** to investors. We're raising $250K-500K to build Move Lyrics - the world's first beat-synchronized dance instruction platform with patent-pending Guitar Hero UI.

The video needs to:
1. ✅ Look futuristic and innovative (justify "patent-pending" claim)
2. ✅ Be easy to understand (non-dancers must get it)
3. ✅ Create "wow factor" (make investors excited)
4. ✅ Show technical feasibility (prove it's not just an idea)

### Success Metrics
If this demo helps us secure funding, there's potential for:
- **Marketing video campaign** (10+ videos for social media)
- **Tutorial video series** (50+ videos with Move Lyrics for actual product)
- **Long-term partnership** (as our official video production partner)

## Budget Discussion

**Ballpark Estimate Request:**
Please provide rough pricing for:

- **Option A:** Full production (20-25s hero video + 10s/15s edits)
- **Option B:** Phased approach (studio only, then add avatar later)
- **Option C:** Static scenes (5 key frames for pitch deck, no animation)

**Our Budget Context:**
- Pre-funding (bootstrapping): $2,000-5,000 max
- Post-seed funding: $10,000-20,000 for full marketing suite

**Timeline Urgency:**
- Pitch deck version needed: 2-3 weeks
- Final polished version: Can wait until post-funding

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review this brief
2. ✅ Let us know if this is within Higgsfield's capabilities
3. ✅ Provide pricing estimate + timeline
4. ✅ Schedule kick-off call to discuss details

**We're excited to work with you on this revolutionary dance education project!** 🚀💃
